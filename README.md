## About

This project is a **modern landing page concept** designed to showcase a digital product, service or SaaS platform.
It includes large hero sections, trust indicators, client reviews, team blocks, interactive accordion, slider and CTA banners.

The goal of the project:

- build a clean, scalable, production-ready layout
- improve maintainability with **BEM class naming**
- enhance adaptability with **CSS variables, grid/flex layouts and clamp() functions**
- remove redundant or unused selectors and unify styles into reusable blocks

This layout can be easily extended with animations, JavaScript logic, or backend/CMS integration.

---

## Features

- **BEM-based structure** — consistent naming across all blocks and components
- **Refactored CSS** with variables, unified spacing, and color system
- **Responsive grid & flexbox layout** supporting all screen sizes
- **Reusable UI components** (buttons, inputs, card layouts, list patterns)
- **Optimized typography** via adaptive units (rem, clamp)
- **Accordion and slider-ready wrappers** for future JS integration
- **Clean semantic HTML5** — improved accessibility and SEO
- **Modern media-query strategy** using mobile-first or desktop-first logic

---

## Technologies

- **HTML5** — semantic and easy to scale
